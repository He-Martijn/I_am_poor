## About this project 

I follow the Flutter course by Angela Yu on Udemy. 
The first lesson was to create an 'I am rich' app. 
After this lessons there is a challenge to create such an app by yourself. 
Which is this project. 

Reading the work of other students is very useful for me.
So by publishing this project I hope to help fellow students. 

I publish this app under the MIT license. 

This app is not going to be published in any app store.
